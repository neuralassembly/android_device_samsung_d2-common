    Vendor-provided fallback fonts

    This file can be edited to add references to fonts that are not installed or referenced in the
    default system. The file should then be placed in /vendor/etc/fallback_fonts.xml.
    See /system/etc/system_fonts.xml and /system/etc/fallback_fonts.xml for more information
    and to understand the order in which the default system fonts are loaded and structured for
    lookup.
